This a program that stores the information of the films that are screened in the different theaters.
The cinema has 3 rooms, there are 2 different hours in each room (4:00 pm and 6:00 pm) and it will have an interactive menu. The program will define the data structures (struct) necessary to store the information about the films: film title, start time and rooms where it is projected, classification (A, B, and C).

- List movies that are being shown on a certain day by rating.
